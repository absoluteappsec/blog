        Absolute AppSec&#39;s 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5IVhnboDIY">147th episode</a>
         featured a can&#39;t-miss discussion with James Kettle (
        <a href="https://twitter.com/albinowax">@albinowax</a>
         on Twitter), 
        a world-class exploit researcher from 
        <a href="https://portswigger.com">Portswigger</a>
        . As the episodes overly dramatic promo highlights, Ken and Seth discovered some interesting details regarding Kettle&#39;s path into security research. But the fun didn&#39;t end there – Kettle provided some valuable insights that could help appsec professionals and bug bounty researchers in furthering their own goals going forward.
    </p>

    <h4 id="toc_2">Here are some episode takeaways.</h4>
            <p>
                <em>
                    <strong>1. Good research serves as a clue that there is more good research from that same source</strong>
                </em>
                 
                <p>In the course of the episode, Kettle credited researchers such as (a) orangetsai 
                <a href="https://blog.orange.tw">(research blog here)</a>
                , (b) regilero 
                <a href="https://regilero.github.io">(research page here)</a>
                , and (c) Amit Klein (Good site for 
                <a href="http://www.securitygalore.com/site3/">his research here</a>
                ) as influential touchpoints for Kettle. Kettle&#39;s personal generosity with acknowledgment and respect is also a nice reminder that the security community can be downright collegial: there&#39;s no reason not to be a mensch.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    <strong>2. Dig into something you don&#39;t understand</strong>
                </em>
                <p>             
                This works as a way to address many researchers&#39; desire to play with something new, not just re-creating XSS all day. Kettle&#39;s first introduction to post-smuggling was listening to regilero&#39;s presentation at defcon 24 &quot;Hiding Wookies in HTTP – HTTP smuggling is a thing we should know bettter and care about,&quot; 
                <a href="https://infocondb.org/con/def-con/def-con-24/hiding-wookiees-in-http-http-smuggling-is-a-thing-we-should-know-better-and-care-about">(infocondb.org)</a>
                 and Kettle&#39;s first impulse was to tell himself he probably didn&#39;t need to understand HTTP smuggling on any deeper level. However, if you fast forward three years, one can see how much work Kettle did to illuminate HTTP smuggling attacks. For example, read his deep dive and watch his discussion of the technique from defcon 27 – 
                <a href="https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn">&quot;HTTP Desync Attacks: Request Smuggling Reborn&quot;</a>
                </p>
            </p>
                <p>Relatedly, Kettle recommends digging into not just exploit vectors, but single applications as well. This is especially true for people looking to increase income in bug bounty research. Truly understanding an application provides greater opportunities for finding the types of vulnerabilities that pay out handsomely. 

                </p>
            <p>
            <em><strong>3. Document, Document</strong></em>
                <p>There are two main points to highlight related to good note-keeping and documentation. First is that a good finding is the key to bug bounty payouts. Show the application owners as articulately and precisely as you can how to re-create your exploit, and your chance of big payouts directly increases. The more long-term benefits for documenting ideas are highlighted by the research trajectory of 
            <em>ALL</em>
             Kettle&#39;s ideas. As Kettle relates, he keeps a list of things that might work, will ruminate on how he can create quick tests to check those ideas regardless of whether he considers the idea &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; when it first germinates.
