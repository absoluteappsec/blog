<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/data-privacy.png" alt="Protecting Data and Privacy" /></p>

<p>In an interesting episode of Absolute Appsec <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgyyCDiIzY4">133</a>, Seth and Ken interviewed Abine.com cofounder Rob Shavell in a wide-ranging discussion concerning data and privacy.</p>

<p>In the historical context, according to Shavell, consumers have largely been persuaded that the promise of technology was worth ceding some privacy. But, since 2016 especially, social media users and online consumers have been made aware of the pitfalls of data tracking and the ways it can be <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/operational-security/big-data/how-to-access-the-voter-information-dirt-cambridge-analytica-has-on-you/a/d-id/741564?_mc=rss_x_drr_edt_aud_dr_x_x-rss-simple">exploited</a>. If there is a tension between privacy and the promise of data-sharing, Shavell sees that a modicum of balance between these two values could start to be restored.</p>

<p>General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/gdpr">GDPR</a>) rules addressing privacy rights in Europe, are increasingly informing emerging privacy/data legal frameworks and future expectations concerning them in the United States. Shavell sees this as a positive development and a new phenomenon.</p>

<p>Coming from a background in venture spaces, Shavell has seen how his once contrarian stance
that prioritized privacy over the technological offerings of data collection and sharing has been significantly mainstreamed. As a result, there’s money behind the interest in data and privacy protection.</p>

<p>For entrepreneurial developers, that means opportunity. Consumers who choosing from among several products or startup are much more likely to opt for or switch to the alternative that best protects personal data and privacy. And the rapid consumer adoption of Abine’s privacy suite: <a href="https://joindeleteme.com">DeleteMe</a>, <a href="https://www.abine.com">Blur</a>, and <a href="https://dnt.abine.com/#feature/tracking">tracker blocker</a> highlights increased interest in protecting personal data.</p>

<p>The second tension discussed in the episode related to the responsibility of developers in keeping privacy protections in mind while they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgyyCDiIzY4?t=2523">Seth’s question</a> elicited a considered response from Shavell. “Privacy by design” is a nice idea, according to Shavell, but decisions concerning how data is used is typically outside the developer’s authority. However, after Ken raised the concern of legal ramifications of a company’s exposure after potential data breaches, everybody agreed that there are significant incentives for developers to pay early attention to data protection in design phases.</p>

<p>Overall, there are reasons for optimism even with the privacy threats illustrated by technology that can be exploited (See, governments’ potential usage of facial recognition or AI).
