Hacker summer camps is approaching, so it's time to make the most of the season by growing your redteam or bug-bounty toolset with Secure Code Review. To that end, Seth and Ken are excited to again be offering their Practical Secure Code Review course at DEF CON in Las Vegas.  Taking place on August 14th and 15th at the Caesar's Forum, this course is a must-attend event for AppSec professional practitioners or even hobbyists seeking to bolster their expertise in secure-code review. With a decades-long track record and a global community of professionals who already utilize their methodology, Seth and Ken are ready to extend the secure-code review methodology and framework to any one who can attend at DEF CON.

AppSec teams and security groups at a range of infosec companies often wonder what the benefits of secure-code review are when dynamic testing or even SAST tools help to cover a lot of bases. Based on the long experience both Ken and Seth have been using secure-code review as part of consultation engagements or internal security teams to find edge cases and vulnerabilities susceptible to chained attacks. In this regard, the significance of secure code cannot be overstated. It serves as the foundation for developing robust and resilient software applications, and the Absolute AppSec methodology developed by Seth and Ken is truly one of the only frameworks that provides language agnostic guidance for diving into any possible codebase with a set of principles and tools you can use to understand the application in front of you and, hopefully, find and remediate critical bugs in short order. 

Throughout the two-day training, participants will delve deep into the art of code review, learning practical techniques for making the best use of your time and then, you’ll put the methodology into practice yourself on a codebase of your own choosing. If you're looking to enhance your skillset and make a lasting impact on the security of software applications, now is a good time to check out Seth and Ken’s Secure-Code Review course. 

As many alumni of the course can attest, the Practical Secure Code Review course at DEF CON will equip you with the essential skills you need to start using secure-code review as part of your application security toolset.
